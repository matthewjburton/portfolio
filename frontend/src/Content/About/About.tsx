            I’m a creator at heart — whether it’s coding, designing, or just trying something new.

            Outside of work, I’m into soccer, pickleball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and recently, golf. During the pandemic, I got into making music, and before that, I studied graphic design.

            I’ve always followed curiosity wherever it leads. What keeps me going is building things that matter, staying connected to good people, and always learning.
