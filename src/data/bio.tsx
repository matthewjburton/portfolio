        I’m a creator at heart — whether it’s coding, designing, or just trying
        something new.
      </div>
      <div>
        Outside of work, my interests include soccer, pickleball, skateboarding,
        snowboarding, painting and recently, golf. During the pandemic, I picked
        up music, and before that, I studied graphic design.
      </div>
      <div>
        I’ve always followed curiosity wherever it leads. What keeps me going is
        building things that matter, staying connected to good people, and
        always learning.
